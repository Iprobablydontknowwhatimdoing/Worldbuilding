# Collaborative Worldbuilding Project
This is a collaborative worldbuilding project intended to be used as a campaign setting for tabletop roleplaying games like _D&D_ or _Pathfinder_. While the setting is aimed at being system-agnostic, for ease of creation, anything which cannot be systems-agnostic will be using the D&D 5e system. The entire project is intended to be used with _Obsidian.md_, a powerful note-taking app.

## Vault Structure
This is for the overall structure of the vault (still in limbo, proposed layout):
 - World
	 - Worldmap (file, no template): Contains the larger worldmap and geography via leaflet, has points on map for countries, big cities, and large geographic regions.
	 - Countries & Regions (folder for each major feature)
		 - Country Map (file, country template): link to the groups counterpart
 - Groups
	 -
