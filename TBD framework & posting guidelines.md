## **Note structure**

Regardless of what app(s) you choose to use, the important thing is that your notes themselves are well organized and readable. This means that you should have some idea of how a page will turn out before you start writing it, as to get some sort of consistency between pages.

Of course, you don't need to use just one method. For your specific needs, you will want to consider some combination of the following, until you end up on what works for you.

### **Systematic approaches**

If you are focused on the nitty-gritty details of worldbuilding, you may want to consider a more systematic approach to note structure. This means dividing ideas into categories and answering questions about individual concepts on a topic-by-topic way (e.g. worksheets).

#### **→ Folders & categories**

If you are a _top-down worldbuilder_, a simple filing system for your world can be a godsend. This way, you can create folders for things you need to elaborate on before you write. Seeing these folders not only helps you visualize what you have, but also what you need to work on. Further, you can apply this type of organization to any app you decide to use.

**One major disadvantage** to this type of system is that it promotes worldbuilding as a checklist. This will sometimes force you to fill out things that either don't matter or that you are not interested in. Worldbuilding like this can become very monotonous, so be sure to take caution when working like this.

#### **→ Encyclopedia & Wiki-style articles**

Much like Wikipedia, this style of notetaking involves explaining specific concepts as individual essays. Wiki-style articles also typically include cross-referencing concepts and proper nouns within pages, creating an improved reading experience. Much like an encyclopedia, templating is the most powerful aspect of worldbuilding in this way, allowing you to effectively create your own worksheets for different topics. If you are vigilant in cross-referencing your pages, notetaking in this way can be very fun because there will always be something discretely available to write about, in the form of links that lead to blank pages. However, be aware that the amount of links to unwritten pages you have will increase exponentially (if this is something that bothers you).

- **Many Wiki apps have their own unique framework.** Please see below app section to browse.
- **[Wikipedia Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Contents)** is a dense read, but contains the list of frameworks that all Wikipedia articles adhere to. For the most authentic Wiki experience, we suggest that you simply look at existing pages on Wikipedia that are similar to your page and copy the outline and info box (e.g. if you are writing a page about an animal, look up "Dog" in Wikipedia to get an idea of what information to include).
- **[One approach to filling out a Wiki](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/4kl0bh/for_a_world_wiki_which_is_better_a_lot_of_wip/d3fxnvc/)** by [/u/akhier](https://safereddit.com/u/akhier). This amounts to beginning with a concept, without fleshing it out, then linking any proper nouns and words good for cross-referencing to a new page. In the end, you will have a list of pages with maybe a sentence or two on them, ready to further flesh out.

#### **→ Templates & worksheets**

If you like filling out paperwork for fun, look no further! Many worldbuilders like to approach notetaking as a series of questions. This approach helps with consistency in what you know and what you consider between related concepts. More often than not, worksheets will help you remember to answer questions you may have forgotten to address for each and every page you create. The limits of these templates is only limited to how much you want to answer. This means that, for the meticulous, templating can get very slow and arduous if you have to fill out each detail of a (perhaps) not-very-important person, place, or thing. Otherwise, this method is quite effective and _will_ get things done.

#### **→ Timelines**

Timelines are very useful for showing cause and effect within your world, especially if you are worldbuilding on a larger time-scale. They can also be very flexible, if you wish to go into detail by year, month, week, day, etc. Unlike the other aforementioned notetaking methods, timelines have an inherent sense of plot—which may be of particular interest to story writers. Timelines also do not need to be limited to text. For instance, if you are developing a setting with a complex political playground, a series of political maps ([example here](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5u8ff9/how_do_you_organize_your_world/dds46e4/)) can be useful too.

- **There are specific tools that can help you visualize time.** See more in the apps section below.
- **Consider the time-scale:** Two examples of suggested approaches can be [era by era](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/61p7hl/how_to_organize_a_world_a_clarification_of_a/dfghbip/), as suggested by [/u/dochayse](https://safereddit.com/u/dochayse) or [month by month, year by year](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5u8ff9/how_do_you_organize_your_world/dds46e4/) as suggested by [/u/J_Webb](https://safereddit.com/u/J_Webb)
- **To focus your timeline, consider breaking down your timeline into sections:** You can try [multiple topical timelines](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5osfy4/i_really_really_suggest_having_a_timeline_and/) (e.g. "inventions by year") or grouping [events by locale or landmark](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/2psnyq/how_do_you_make_a_timeline_for_a_world/cn03479/) (e.g. "events near X").
- **Timelines can be easily organized in Google Sheets or Excel** ([example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NwoGhz-fW_54YAspNBaB_3mxJooduDqedP13uQNV-AU/edit#gid=14) by [/u/AnimaRytak](https://safereddit.com/u/AnimaRytak))

### **Non-systematic approaches**

If you are not as concerned by the fine details of your world, it may suffice to just write what you need to, with no intention to explain everything. Especially for fantastical settings, these approaches can also drastically improve the reading experience by thrusting the viewer into a setting where not everything is known. This act of almost "worldbuilding by omission" is extremely effective _because_ it does not answer every question.

These methods also allow you to exert a much greater level of freedom and may be particularly suited to story-driven worldbuilders.

#### **→ Free-form**

Working in a free-form way is generally haphazard, but can lead to great success if you have trouble working structurally. This strategy amounts to simply writing however much you want, whenever you want, with little or no direction. This style can open up a more brainstorm-like document. While you may miss addressing some points explicitly detailed in a worksheet, you will end up with a more organic piece.

Some tips to follow:

- **Still organize your notes.** Break down your files into broad "concept categories" and organize them in folders, similar to the "[folder system](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/wiki/edit/organizational_tools#wiki_.2192_folders_.26_categories)" above.
- **Use a [table of contents](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5wzycx/how_do_you_document_your_world/dee8hq2/).** Google Docs has this feature built in to the service, while also hosting your files online.
- **If you take separate notes, compile them frequently.** For the sake of consistency, if you make one larger "master file" for your overall world, you can use that file as a guideline for future notes. This helps prevent contradictions in the event you forgot something.

#### **→ In-world lore**

One common technique to worldbuild is to take notes in the form of in-world lore. That is, you write from the perspective of someone residing in the world itself. These works can include, but are not limited to historians, myths, religious texts, legends, diaries/journals, scientific articles, newspapers, brochures, atlases, propaganda, letters, textbooks, dictionaries, even tax forms.

This style of notetaking can be quite fun, because you are now opening up the subject of how the characters in your world react to the content—as well as how the reader should interpret it as well. Characters in-world seldom know as much as the worldbuilder themselves, allow us to forge a narrative.

- **In-world lore can also be used as presentation.** Since you are taking care to write from the perspective of the character(s), these works tend to be richer than, say, an encyclopedia entry. Ultimately, you may even deem this collection of in-world writing to be publishable in its own right.
- **Consider taking multiple perspectives.** For instance, you may have different historians from different backgrounds analyzing a certain event. Based on their individual beliefs, you can imply a lot about the places they are from, as well as the history of the world.
- **Be mindful of which perspective you take.** Only write what the character(s) would know / would be exposed to. Don't break realism by overstepping that character's knowledge.
- **Keep a consistent personality and voice.** Especially if you have multiple in-world writers, make sure they are unique, but also recognizable.
- **Acknowledge that you cannot present every facet this way.** This is both a weakness and a strength.

#### **→ Plot & campaign-based**

If your world unravels as the result of a distinct plot or campaign, you may just want to write chapter-by-chapter or session-by-session. Think of worldbuilding in this way as almost drafting for a novel. While you don't necessarily have to have any, this style of notetaking lends itself especially to narrative. Take notes as they happen, and with respect to other major events that have occurred or will occur.

- **Plot-keeping apps are a gold standard.** See apps section for more information.
- **Keep in mind the big picture.** Keep a separate notebook for details about the overall world and the long-term timeline you have planned out.
- **You can organize plot by character.** Especially if you are running a campaign with other people, you can limit the scope of knowledge of certain players at any given time. One way to approach this is to use [permissions in Google Drive](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ynd79/how_do_you_keep_things_organized/c5x675u/) so players can only view / edit / comment on certain things.
- **Consider using [games as a platform for worldbuilding](https://safereddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/13swp0/recommendations_for_pen_paper_worldbuilding_games/).** It's fairly uncommon, but people have had success building entire worlds within game, or as mods to games.

#### **→ Sourcebooks**

A sourcebook is a compendium of information about a world that acts as an overview to it. For example, a D&D Sourcebook goes into the general concepts, races, creatures, rules, and sample scenarios for a campaign, but does not _tell_ the story for you. As a work, sourcebooks tend to be a mash-up of narrative, Wiki-style notes, templates, and art. While there can be some fine detail, this style of notetaking is moreso about the general picture and need-to-know concepts.

For a quick read on this topic, check out [this thread from /r/RPG](https://safereddit.com/r/rpg/comments/6k3i0l/what_are_some_examples_of_well_designed_rpg_books/).

Something related to the sourcebook is the **gazette**, an article or travel guide to your world. Rather than focusing on compiling information, a gazette aims more for the presentation of the world in a concise, digestible manner. Unlike sourcebooks, gazettes aren't necessarily reference guides. I cannot attest to the efficacy of [this book](http://www.storybones.net/bookstore/world-building/gazetteer-writers-manual/) (costs money), but I thought it was worth mentioning because it appeared in the masterpost.
