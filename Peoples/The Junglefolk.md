# The Keeper and the Bestoned
The Verdan all report to a semi-religious figure who resides on an island in the middle of the giant river that goes through the jungle, though its exact location is unknown. The figure who rules the Verdan is known to most of the tribesman as "the Keeper of the World-Snakes", a reference to their creation story of the hundred many-eyed snakes who birthed the worlds. The Keeper of snakes maintains a small group of advisors who interface with the leaders of the many tribes spread throughout the jungle, and to whom the Keeper can speak without physical contact through some kind of spell or mind link. The inner circle, known as the Bestoned, are marked with a gold snake inlayed into their skin, with two rubies for eyes, which twists up their arms.  When the Bestoned cast spells, the snake glows gold and twists around their arms, hissing. All Bestoned also ride a large lizard, said to be granted to the Keeper by the Snakes themselves, which are adept at moving through the forest quickly. They also, in a ritual during a new tribe-leader's innitiation, give a young lizard to the tribe leader as a sign of the Keepers recognition of the selection. There are always twelve Bestoned, and they command unparalleled respect from the other Verdan, and are generally reguarded as superior to the tribe leaders, though it is a different chain of command, and it would be a severe breach for any of the Bestoned to give an order directly to a tribesman without going through the tribe leader (although if the tribe leader has died or is incapacitated as well as their second, a Bestoned will gain temporary control until a new tribe leader has been elected). It would also be an equal breach for a tribe leader to conduct a ceremony directly, as that is a job of the Bestoned. The Bestoned also live an unnaturally long time, and none have been replaced in recent memory.

# The Tribes of the Jungle
The tribes of the jungle are each represented by a creature, always an apex predator. There are currently eight, but the number of tribes fluctuates based on the number of Verdan inhabiting the jungle, and based on the political situation. Raids on rival tribes are not uncommon, but there is rarely all-out war between any two tribes, and people rarely die in raids. Trade is common, but only in times of surplus. If one tribe is doing very badly, then people of that tribe can abandon it and join another tribe at the lowest ranking. The most common trade between tribes is food, and some items of trade are banned entirely. Perhaps most notably from a cultural significance, any items gained from hunting the animal a tribe is represented by must stay in that tribe, and cannot be traded. Furthermore, the leader of a tribe always wears a coat made of the skin of the animal who's tribe they lead. Hunting any of the apex predators of the jungle is always a ritual affair, and any hunting of them for food or for sport is strictly banned by the Keeper. All tribesmen have a magical tatoo inked on their skin made from the ashes of a jungle tree, which is soaked in the water of the great jungle river for 24 hours, before being blessed by a
