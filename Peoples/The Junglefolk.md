The Junglefolk is a blanket term used by the imperial subjects to refer to the many tribes of Verdan nomads that reside in the great jungles of northern [[Eyedona]].  ?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aw%C3%A1_(Brazil) (not based on this, but maybe can use as a reference) (https://www.survivalinternational.org/awa)

# The Keeper and the Bestoned
The Verdan all report to a semi-religious figure who resides on an island in the middle of the giant river that goes through the jungle, though its exact location is unknown. The figure who rules the Verdan is known to most of the tribesman as "the Keeper of the World-Snakes", a reference to their creation story of the hundred many-eyed snakes who birthed the worlds. The Keeper of snakes maintains a small group of advisors who interface with the leaders of the many tribes spread throughout the jungle, and to whom the Keeper can speak without physical contact through some kind of spell or mind link. The inner circle, known as the Bestoned, are marked with a gold snake inlayed into their skin, with two rubies for eyes, which twists up their arms.  When the Bestoned cast spells, the snake glows gold and twists around their arms, hissing. All Bestoned also ride a large lizard, said to be granted to the Keeper by the Snakes themselves, which are adept at moving through the forest quickly. They also, in a ritual during a new tribe-leader's innitiation, give a young lizard to the tribe leader as a sign of the Keepers recognition of the selection. There are always twelve Bestoned, and they command unparalleled respect from the other Verdan, and are generally reguarded as superior to the tribe leaders, though it is a different chain of command, and it would be a severe breach for any of the Bestoned to give an order directly to a tribesman without going through the tribe leader (although if the tribe leader has died or is incapacitated as well as their second, a Bestoned will gain temporary control until a new tribe leader has been elected). It would also be an equal breach for a tribe leader to conduct a ceremony directly, as that is a job of the Bestoned. The Bestoned also live an unnaturally long time, and none have been replaced in recent memory.

# The Tribes of the Jungle
The tribes of the jungle are each represented by a creature, always an apex predator. There are currently 8, but the number of tribes fluctuates based on the number of Verdan and the political situation. Raids on rival tribes are not uncommon, but there is rarely all-out war between any two tribes, and people rarely die in raids. Trade is common, but only in times of surplus. If one tribe is doing very badly, then people of that tribe can abandon it and join another tribe at the lowest ranking. The most common trade between tribes is food, and some items of trade are banned entirely. Perhaps most notably from a cultural significance, any items gained from hunting the animal a tribe is represented by must stay in that tribe, and cannot be traded. Furthermore, the leader of a tribe always wears a coat made of the skin of the animal who's tribe they lead. Hunting any of the apex predators of the jungle is always a ritual affair, and any hunting of them for food or for sport is strictly banned by the Keeper. All tribesmen have a magical tattoo inked on their skin made from the ashes of a jungle tree, which is soaked in the water of the great jungle river for 24 hours, before being blessed by a Bestoned and finally inked into the subject's skin with a snake bone. The tattoo depicts the tribe they belong to and the family of their birth. They receive the tattoo when they grow to be 15 the evening after their first *great hunt*.
## Political Structure of the Tribes
The political structure of the tribes is complicated to say the least, as soft power and debt are wielded like sharp weapons, and the prince of a tribe might have less sway than the lowliest of members. Honor and martial prowess is preferred over bloodlines and political legitimacy, and fights are common, as are contests of honor. Every tribe is slightly different, and even for another Verdan of a different tribe it can take years to fully understand all the cultural undertones. The official and top-down structure can be generally summarized as such:
- **The Tribe Leader** - the tribe leader is the member of the tribe who makes important decisions, and who is in charge of diplomacy between tribes. The leader can also order all tribesman, though if the orders be too outrageous, they can be challenged in a trial of honor (except in circumstances that would not allow it, such as in the middle of a fight or a negotiation). Only over an official order can a tribe leader be challenged, so leaders tend to avoid giving direct orders to members of the tribe with more sway. Sometimes if an influential member wants to challenge a leader, they will try to trick the leader into giving them a direct order so then can offer a challenge.
- **Squad Leaders** - lead a group of Verdan, second highest in martial order. Squad leaders often fall in and out of favor with the Tribe Leader. Squads of Verdan form hunting groups, who go through the jungle to hunt animals and forage for food. It is the squad leaders duty to, while reporting to the Tribe Leader, look after the safety and well being of their squad first. The Tribe Leader's job it to look after the safety and well being of the whole tribe. It would be unusual for a squad leader to officially suggest a course of action that would benefit the Tribe more than the squad who they lead, not out of self interest, but because of the cultural role they play. While squad leaders might, and often do, suggest those courses, it will happen behind closed doors. Squad leaders also command the most respect of all the figures in the tribe, more than the tribe leader. The tribe leader is not seen as a godly figure, but rather more like a beurocrat, but the Squad Leaders can go on hunts and earn honor and glory, which will gain them respect in the tribe. The Squad leaders also hold ultimate control over the members of their squad, and as it would be a transgression for a Bestoned to order the members of a tribe, so would it be a transgression for the Tribe leader to order the members of a Squad.
	- Fights between squads are common, but never is blood shed unless honor is challenged. Squads recognize that of the tribe, they are the minority supporting the majority, and will not injure each other if they can help it. There is a lot of political maneuvering, however, and contests and competitions are common.
- **Cook** - While any of the tribe know how to cook, the cook is a person who is not part of a squad, or someone who has divulged themselves from a squad on purpose, and makes intricate meals from the variety of spices and seasonings, and the meals are created often for rituals or important events. The knowledge of how these meals are made are passed down from cook to cook. The cook can also order people to obtain food for the tribe when a larger meal is required, and is in charge of dolling food out to the tribe.
- **Poisonist** - This person keeps a variety of poisonous pets, and from them creates a variety of poisons which are used to fight the empire and explorers who might encroach on their territory. This role was created not long ago as the empire has started to encroach upon their territory. The poisons that this person makes are deadly very quickly, and people who encounter it rarely survive. While the empire has many people who specialize in identifying artifacts and chemicals, both magical or otherwise, they have yet to create an antidote, though the tribes always know the antivenom before distributing it.
