## Editing Guidelines: Following Wikipedia
- Capitalize the initial letter (except in rare cases, such as eBay), but otherwise follow [sentence case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_case "Sentence case")[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#cite_note-Sentence_case-5) (Funding of UNESCO projects), not title case (Funding of UNESCO Projects), except where title case would be used in ordinary prose. See [Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_\(capitalization\) "Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)").
- Do not use [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_\(grammar\) "Article (grammar)") (_a_, _an_, or _the_) as the first word (Economy of the Second Empire, not The economy of the Second Empire), unless it is an inseparable part of a name (The Hague) or of the title of a work (_A Clockwork Orange_, _The Simpsons_).
- Normally use [nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun") or [noun phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase "Noun phrase"): Early life, not In early life.[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#cite_note-6)
- The final character should not be punctuation unless it is an inseparable part of a name ([Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Louis-du-Ha!_Ha! "Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!"), _[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?")_) or an abbreviation ([Inverness City F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_City_F.C. "Inverness City F.C.")), or when a closing round bracket or quotation mark is required ([_John Palmer_ (1814 schooner)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palmer_\(1814_schooner\) "John Palmer (1814 schooner)")).
